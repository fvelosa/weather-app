## Comments

* The scafolding of the application was done using angular-webpack-flow
* Tests are superficial and a production application would need much more edge scenarios that could never crash de app
* Needs improvement in design, the focus was on application structure
* Needs proper error handling

## Bugs and limitations

* Very little functionality is implemented, the focus was on application structure
* Does not have end to end tests
* The system does not have persistency, all values are in memmory
* This simple version only allows a location at a time
* Code names are not allways consistent, cities actually can be any location
* Search of city names needs improvement on the query format, sometimes does not return any value
